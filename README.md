This Github Repository contains information about coding and evaluating the existing modeling methods of constructing
gene regulatory networks for single-cell data. Six total methods have been analyzed and implemented: GENIE3, GRNBOOST2, PIDC, PPCOR, LEAP, SCODE.
This repository contains several folders.

The Algorithms Folder: The individual step-by-step codes for installing and running the six single-cell GRN construction methods.

The Data Folder: The original dataset and ground truth network used.

The Documentation Folder: The pdf files describing each method, main functions/ paramters in the packages, theoretical measures and equations underlying
the methods, as well as more specific background details about each method.
